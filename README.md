## v1.0 (July 26, 2021)

[Download](https://github.com/Manoonchai/Manoonchai/releases)

```plaintext
(AltGr Layer)
["๑", "๒", "๓", "๔", "๕", "๖", "๗", "๘", "๙", "๐", "÷", "×"]
[---, ---, ---, ---, ---, ---, "ฺ", ---, ---, ---, "[", "]", "\"]
["◌", "๏", "๛", "฿", ---, "ํ", "ๅ", "ฃ", ---, ";", "'"]
["ฦ", ---, "๚", ---, ---, "ฅ", "๎", ",", ".", "/"]
```

- Like v0.3, but add `AltGr` layer to support remaining characters & common symbols for ease of use.
- `AltGr` layer is `Option` key on macOS, `Left Ctrl+Alt` or `Right Alt` on Windows.

## v0.3 (May 6, 2021)

[Download printable format](https://github.com/narze/Manoonchai/files/6438811/layout.pdf)

```plaintext
["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "="]
["ใ", "ต", "ห", "ล", "ส", "ป", "ั", "ก", "ิ", "บ", "็", "ฬ", "ฯ"]
["ง", "เ", "ร", "น", "ม", "อ", "า", "่", "้", "ว", "ื"]
["ุ", "ไ", "ท", "ย", "จ", "ค", "ี", "ด", "ะ", "ู"]
["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "_", "+"]
["ฒ", "ฏ", "ซ", "ญ", "ฟ", "ฉ", "ึ", "ธ", "ฐ", "ฎ", "ฆ", "ฑ", "ฌ"]
["ษ", "ถ", "แ", "ช", "พ", "ผ", "ำ", "ข", "โ", "ภ", "\""]
["ฤ", "ฝ", "ๆ", "ณ", "๊", "๋", "์", "ศ", "ฮ", "?"]
```

- Contributed by ([@iNViTiON](https://github.com/iNViTiON))
- Replaced `฿` with `"`
- Moved `฿`, `"`, `ฑ`, `ฌ`, `ฬ`, `ฯ` to the right most
- Effort is slightly reduced, but acceptable for real world usage

## v0.2 (May 1, 2021)

```plaintext
["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","0","-","="]
["พ","ค","ย","ว","ล","ป","ั","ก","ต","บ","็","ู","์"]
["ห","เ","น","ร","ม","อ","า","่","้","ง","ื"]
["ช","ไ","ส","ท","จ","ิ","ี","ด","ะ","ุ"]
["!","@","#","$","%","^","&","*","(",")","_","+"]
["ฑ","ฒ","ษ","ญ","ฟ","ฎ","ฉ","ภ","ฐ","ฤ","ฆ","ฌ","ฯ"]
["ๆ","ถ","แ","ข","ผ","ึ","ใ","ำ","โ","ศ","ฮ"]
["ฬ","๋","๊","ซ","ฝ","?","ณ","ธ","ฏ","฿"]
```

After model optimization, weight adjustment and more than 10 million iterations, this layout achieve 49.5% improvement from Kedmanee.

## v0.1 (April 24, 2021)

Generated from [Carpalx-th](https://github.com/narze/carpalx-th), and edited by hand to make it more sensible. AltGr layer not available yet so `ฃ`, `ฅ` will be missing.

```plaintext
["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "="]
["ู", "พ", "ง", "ส", "ต", "ค", "ั", "อ", "บ", "ป", "็", "ๆ", "ฐ"]
["ว", "ก", "น", "ร", "ย", "เ", "่", "า", "ม", "ี", "ะ"]
["ท", "ใ", "ห", "ล", "ช", "ไ", "้", "ด", "ุ", "์"]
["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "_", "+"]
["ฯ", "ฏ", "ษ", "ศ", "ซ", "๊", "โ", "ฬ", "ภ", "ฮ", "ฒ", "ฤ", "ฑ"]
["ธ", "ข", "แ", "ญ", "จ", "ถ", "ิ", "ื", "ำ", "ึ", "๋"]
["ฆ", "ฌ", "ฉ", "ผ", "ฝ", "฿", "ณ", "ฟ", "ฎ", "?"]
```

## Why?

Most of the problems are like problems with QWERTY layout, both Kedmanee & Pattachote layouts are:

- Invented for typewriters which have been long gone these days
- Very old (50+ years!)
- tba

## Key Features

- Use Arabic numbers by default
- No Thai alphabets on number row
- Tested with modern dataset
- Support all keyboard form factors down to 40%

## เวอร์ชั่น 1.0 (26 กรกฎาคม 2564)

[ดาวน์โหลด](https://github.com/Manoonchai/Manoonchai/releases)

```plaintext
(AltGr Layer)
["๑", "๒", "๓", "๔", "๕", "๖", "๗", "๘", "๙", "๐", "÷", "×"]
[---, ---, ---, ---, ---, ---, "ฺ", ---, ---, ---, "[", "]", "\"]
["◌", "๏", "๛", "฿", ---, "ํ", "ๅ", "ฃ", ---, ";", "'"]
["ฦ", ---, "๚", ---, ---, "ฅ", "๎", ",", ".", "/"]
```

- เช่นเดียวกับ เวอร์ชั่น 0.3 แต่เพิ่มเลเยอร์ `AltGr` เพื่อรองรับอักขระที่เหลือและสัญลักษณ์ทั่วไปเพื่อความสะดวกในการใช้งาน
- เลเยอร์ `AltGr` คือปุ่ม `Option` บน macOS และ `Ctrl+Alt` ซ้ายหรือ `Alt` ขวา บน Windows

## เวอร์ชั่น 0.3 (6 พฤษภาคม 2564)

[ดาวน์โหลดรูปแบบการพิมพ์](https://github.com/narze/Manoonchai/files/6438811/layout.pdf)

```plaintext
["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "="]
["ใ", "ต", "ห", "ล", "ส", "ป", "ั", "ก", "ิ", "บ", "็", "ฬ", "ฯ"]
["ง", "เ", "ร", "น", "ม", "อ", "า", "่", "้", "ว", "ื"]
["ุ", "ไ", "ท", "ย", "จ", "ค", "ี", "ด", "ะ", "ู"]
["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "_", "+"]
["ฒ", "ฏ", "ซ", "ญ", "ฟ", "ฉ", "ึ", "ธ", "ฐ", "ฎ", "ฆ", "ฑ", "ฌ"]
["ษ", "ถ", "แ", "ช", "พ", "ผ", "ำ", "ข", "โ", "ภ", "\""]
["ฤ", "ฝ", "ๆ", "ณ", "๊", "๋", "์", "ศ", "ฮ", "?"]
```

- Contributed โดย ([@iNViTiON](https://github.com/iNViTiON))
- แทนที่ `฿` ด้วย `"`
- ย้าย `฿`, `"`, `ฑ`, `ฌ`, `ฬ`, `ฯ` ไปทางขวาเป็นส่วนใหญ่
- ความพยายามลดลงเล็กน้อยแต่รับได้กับการใช้งานจริง

## เวอร์ชั่น0.2 (1 พฤษภาคม 2564เ)

```plaintext
["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","0","-","="]
["พ","ค","ย","ว","ล","ป","ั","ก","ต","บ","็","ู","์"]
["ห","เ","น","ร","ม","อ","า","่","้","ง","ื"]

["ๆ","ถ","แ","ข","ผ","ึ","ใ","ำ","โ","ศ","ฮ"]
["ฬ","๋","๊","ซ","ฝ","?","ณ","ธ","ฏ","฿"]
```

หลังจากการเพิ่มประสิทธิภาพแป้นพิมพ์ การปรับน้ำหนัก และการประมวลผลมากกว่า 10 ล้านครั้ง แป้นพิมพ์นี้ได้รับการปรับปรุงให้ดีกว่าเกษมณีถึง 49.5%

## เวอร์ชั่น0.1 (24 เมษายน 2564)

สร้างจาก [Carpalx-th](https://github.com/narze/carpalx-th) และแก้ไขด้วยคนเพื่อให้เหมาะกับการใช้งานมากขึ้น เลเยอร์ `AltGr` ยังไม่พร้อมใช้งาน ดังนั้น `ฃ`, `ฅ` จะหายไป

```plaintext
["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "="]
["ู", "พ", "ง", "ส", "ต", "ค", "ั", "อ", "บ", "ป", "็", "ๆ", "ฐ"]
["ว", "ก", "น", "ร", "ย", "เ", "่", "า", "ม", "ี", "ะ"]
["ท", "ใ", "ห", "ล", "ช", "ไ", "้", "ด", "ุ", "์"]
["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "_", "+"]
["ฯ", "ฏ", "ษ", "ศ", "ซ", "๊", "โ", "ฬ", "ภ", "ฮ", "ฒ", "ฤ", "ฑ"]
["ธ", "ข", "แ", "ญ", "จ", "ถ", "ิ", "ื", "ำ", "ึ", "๋"]
["ฆ", "ฌ", "ฉ", "ผ", "ฝ", "฿", "ณ", "ฟ", "ฎ", "?"]
```

## ทำไมต้องมนูญชัย?

ปัญหาส่วนใหญ่จะเหมือนกับปัญหาของ แป้นพิมพ์ QWERTY แป้นพิมพ์เกษมณี และ แป้นพิมพ์ปัตตะโชติ คือ

- คิดค้นสำหรับเครื่องพิมพ์ดีดที่หายไปในทุกวันนี้
- เก่ามาก (50+ ปี!)
- tba

## คุณสมบัติหลัก

- ใช้ตัวเลขอารบิกเป็นค่าเริ่มต้น
- ไม่มีตัวอักษรไทยในแถวตัวเลข
- ทดสอบด้วยชุดข้อมูลที่ทันสมัย
- รองรับคีย์บอร์ดทั้งหมดลงไปถึง 40%
